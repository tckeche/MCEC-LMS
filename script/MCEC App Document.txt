Hi TamukaHere is a comprehensive, development ready application design for the MCEC LMS web app, incorporating every decision and rule we curated.MCEC LMS Web ApplicationComprehensive Application Design and Functional Specification1. Purpose and visionMCEC will build a unified tutoring operations platform that replaces Moodle fully and combines strong LMS capability with a premium, elegant, modern UI.The platform will centralise learning delivery, scheduling, tutor management, reporting, invoicing, payroll, messaging, analytics, and student progress tracking.Web first. Built in a way that is scalable and integratable with a future mobile app.Target scale for early deployment40 staff100 students2. User roles and access control2.1 Core roles1. Students2. Parents3. Tutors4. Managers5. Admins2.2 Admin hierarchy and permissionsThere is a Super Admin and three access levels for admin type users.Level 1Can view hours and operational dataCan deactivate student accountsCannot view finances, invoices, payslips, payroll dataLevel 2Can view finances, invoices, payslips, payroll dataCan view everything elseLevel 3Full control including editing everythingCan assign roles and approve admin accountsManager permissionsManager Level 1 is view onlyManager Level 3 can editManagers Level 1, 2, and 3 can approve monthly reports2.3 Account separationAccounts are strictly separate. If a person becomes a tutor or admin later, they register again as a new profile.2.4 Identity and sign up verificationAdmins and staff sign up using @melaniacalvin.com email onlyStaff sign up requires an OTP code sent to their MCEC emailAdmin account approval is done by Level 3 adminStudents sign up using SMS OTPParents sign up using SMS OTPSingle sign on for staff is required, Microsoft SSO, alongside the OTP driven onboarding flow.3. Platform modules1. Dashboard and calendar2. Courses and learning workspace3. Scheduling and availability4. Live tutorial delivery via Microsoft Teams5. Transcripts, lesson summaries, and lesson PDFs6. Quizzes and assignments7. Attendance, lateness, and session audit trail8. Tutor monthly reports and approvals9. Finance, invoicing, credits, and payment tracking10. Payroll and payslips with approval workflow11. Messaging and communication12. Analytics and performance dashboards13. Security, audit logs, and compliance4. Student dashboard experienceWhen a student logs in, they see a modern cards and tiles dashboard with:1. Course cards for all enrolled courses2. A calendar with month, week, and day views3. Course progress indicators4. Messaging entry points to staff and course chats5. Quick view of upcoming tutorials and pending assignments4.1 Subject colour systemEvery course has a colour identity.The same colour is used consistently in:Course cardCalendar eventsProgress donut chartsCourse views4.2 Progress trackingProgress is measured using scheduled hours that originate from paid hours on the invoice.Each course shows a donut chart and fraction:Completed hours versus remaining hoursOn the dashboard, students see the donut charts for all courses.4.3 Report visibility ruleStudents cannot view the narrative reports.Students can view simplified progress such as attendance and quiz results.Parents, tutors, and managers can view reports.5. Parent portalParents have their own user profile and can log in to view:1. Student course progress2. Attendance and punctuality indicators3. Quiz and assignment results4. Tutor reports5. Invoices, payment status, statements, and downloadable PDFs6. Messaging, including direct messaging to tutorsInvoices and monthly documents are still sent automatically at month end.6. Course model and structureA course is the main container for learning and operations.Each course includes:SubjectLevelSyllabus labelCourse mode, one to one or groupUnique backend course ID, invisible to usersPrimary tutorOptional co tutorsEnrolled studentsCourse colourCourse hours package and rate data tied to billingBackend naming convention exampleA course displayed as AS Maths on the front end, but stored uniquely as something like Maths_AS_TutorName_01.6.1 Multiple tutors per subjectA student can have multiple tutors for the same subject area. This is handled as separate courses per tutor.6.2 Co tutor behaviourCo tutors can:Upload filesCreate assignmentsRun sessionsView course contentThey cannot write monthly reports. Only the primary tutor is responsible for reports.Co tutors are paid for the sessions they run.The primary tutor can change over time if needed.7. Group tutorialsGroup courses allow multiple students to share the same session schedule.RulesAll students in the group share the same session time alwaysOnly the tutor can initiate postponements for a group courseStudents cannot individually postpone group sessionsGroup sessions still consume hours per student individuallyExample: a 90 minute group session causes each enrolled student to lose 90 minutesGroup reportingOne group narrative report per monthPlus a per student attendance register and performance recordGrades in group reporting are averages, with mean and median shown, and outliers explained8. Scheduling and availabilityScheduling is flexible but structured monthly.8.1 Availability systemTutors define availability and unavailability for the next three months.Students can view tutor availability and propose times.Scheduling negotiation workflow1. Student proposes session times from available slots2. Tutor approves or proposes alternatives3. Back and forth continues until sessions are finalised4. The system locks the month schedule into the calendar for both parties8.2 Session durationSessions can be scheduled in 15 minute blocks.8.3 Double booking preventionThe system must prevent clashes automatically for:Tutor calendarsStudent calendarsGroup session calendars8.4 Calendar itemsCalendar must include:Tutorial sessionsAssignment deadlinesQuiz availability windowsPostponed and missed session flags9. Postponements and missed sessions9.1 Postponement windowA tutorial is postponeable if the request happens at least 120 minutes before start time.Less than 120 minutes counts as missed.There is also a student reminder timed at 2 hours 15 minutes before the tutorial to encourage confirmation or early postponement, to avoid penalties.You also want a short action window close to a session. Students can cancel or postpone up to 15 minutes before start, but if within 120 minutes it is treated under missed rules and penalties.9.2 Missed session ruleIf the tutorial is missed under 120 minutes notice:It is marked as missedIt consumes 50 percent of the session duration from the student hoursThis is logged and visible in reports and dashboards9.3 Postponement approvalBoth student and tutor can request postponement for one to one courses.Tutor must respond within 24 hours.If denied, tutor must propose a different day and time.Group courses are tutor controlled only.9.4 Visual markingPostponed tutorials must be marked using a different colour across calendar and dashboards.10. Access control based on payment and hoursThere are two related but distinct states.10.1 Hours expiredStudent can still view course content, files, summaries, and historyStudent cannot join tutorialsJoin Tutorial button is greyed outMessage shown: pay for more tutorials to continue10.2 Account deactivatedStudent can log in but cannot view course materialsA prominent banner message instructs them to pay to regain access11. Live tutorials via Microsoft Teams11.1 Primary approachTenant level integration is desired for reliability.However, tutors may paste their own Teams links.11.2 Link handlingTutors can paste a Teams link any time.Join Tutorial opens inside the app experience, then routes into Teams.11.3 Transcript policyIf the meeting is hosted under MCEC managed Microsoft 365, the system should fetch transcript automatically where possible.If the tutor uses a non MCEC Teams link, transcript upload becomes mandatory.If transcript is missing, the tutor must upload a readable transcript file to close the session record.Accepted formatsAny readable format, including pdf, docx, txt, vtt.Recordings are not required.12. Session tracking, attendance, and punctuality12.1 What is recorded automaticallyWhen student presses Join TutorialWhen tutor presses Join TutorialWhen the Teams meeting endsPre agreed session durationActual meeting duration12.2 Billing and hours deduction triggerHours are deducted when the student presses Join Tutorial.Billing is based on the pre agreed scheduled duration, not on overrun time.12.3 Late joinsStudent lateness has no penalty rule for now.Tutor lateness ruleIf tutor joins more than 10 minutes late, the system flags it and notifies managers.Billing should count from tutor join time only.Managers receive a lateness report event.12.4 Overrun handlingIf a session runs longer than scheduled:Extra time is ignored for billingTutor receives a reminder notification stating the tutorial ran longer than scheduled and extra time is not paid12.5 DisputesA dispute button exists for parents and managers to raise a session dispute for review.13. Lesson summaries and PDFs13.1 Lesson summary generationAfter each session, the system generates an automatic summary using the transcript only.Summary is always automatic.13.2 Summary templateStandard MCEC lesson note template is required.It must include key points, what was covered, what was practised, and next steps.Homework section should exist even if blank.13.3 StorageEach session has:Transcript fileLesson summary PDF stored under Previous Lessons in the courseThe PDF must include:Student nameTutor nameCourse nameDateScheduled durationTime joined and time endedTranscripts are retained forever, with an option to hide if needed.14. Quizzes14.1 Two quiz moments per tutorialQuiz AImmediately after the tutorial10 multiple choice questionsBased on transcript contentOne attempt onlyImmediate feedback per question, including explanationQuiz B30 minutes before the next tutorial starts10 multiple choice questionsOne attempt onlyImmediate feedback per questionAutomatically closes at tutorial start timeQuiz is optional and does not block joining the next tutorial.Difficulty must match course level, for example AS level questions for AS courses.14.2 Review accessAfter completion, quizzes are reviewable by student and tutor.15. AssignmentsEach course contains an Assignments tab.Tutors can create an assignment with:TitleInstructionsDeadlineAssigned to individual or groupStudents can upload multiple pages as pdf, plus images.Students can resubmit before deadline.Tutor gradingMark out of 100Optional commentAssignments appear on the student calendar as deadline events.Assignment grades appear alongside quiz grades in the grade view.16. Tutor monthly reports16.1 Frequency and structureReports are per course per month.Content includes:Hours completed that monthTutor comments and suggestionsAssessment results including quiz and assignment gradesExplanation for missed or outstanding tutorialsAttendance register versus scheduled tutorialsGroup course reports are generalised.Grades must include mean and median and outlier explanation.16.2 Approval workflowDraft is visible to tutor and managers.Managers Level 1, 2, and 3 can approve.After approval, parents can view and download PDF reports.Students cannot view narrative reports.17. Finance and invoicing17.1 Enrolment data captureAdmins enrol students and capture:SubjectsSyllabusLevelRate per hourFee payer detailsParent profile linkage17.2 Invoice structureInvoices are pro forma.One line per subject.Each line includes:Subject and levelMode, one to one or groupIncluded hours for the monthRate per hourLine totalExample lineAS Maths one to one tutorials, 8 hours, rate per hour 20, total 160Invoice numberingStrict sequence format like INV00122317.3 CurrencyInvoices can be generated in USD, ZAR, or Pound Sterling, selectable.17.4 Payment trackingPayments are tracked with statuses:UnpaidPartially paidPaidOverdueParents or students can upload proof of payment.Admins verify and mark as paid.Cash delivery is supported and must be admin verified.17.5 Automatic remindersAutomatic payment reminders are required:Before month endOn invoice issue dateAfter overdue thresholdsLate payment consequenceBlock access according to the account and hours rules.17.6 Credits and rolloversHours can roll over only under the rollover rule you set.Unused hours can roll over if postponed before 2 hours of the next tutorial.Mid month top ups are allowed without regenerating the entire invoice.The system must also generate statements per parent showing invoices, payments, and balances.18. Payroll and payslips18.1 Pay basisTutors are paid per hour completed.Different pay rates per tutor.Deductions and bonuses are not required now but the system must allow adding them later.Tutors get paid regardless of whether the parent has paid.However, the system must flag cases where tutor payment is being processed against unpaid parent invoices.18.2 Payroll cycle and workflowPayroll closes at 23:59 on the last day of the month.Payslips are generated automatically, but sending is automatic only after admin approval per tutor.Workflow statesDraftSubmittedApprovedPaid18.3 Payslip contentsA payslip must include detailed session breakdown per student:Student nameCourseDatesSession durationsHourly pay rateLine totalsTotal hoursGross payAdjustments, optional futureNet payPayslips are emailed to tutors and stored for admin access.Admin staff can also receive payslips.19.
