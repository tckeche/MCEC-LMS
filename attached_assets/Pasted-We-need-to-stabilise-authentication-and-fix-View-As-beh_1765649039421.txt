We need to stabilise authentication and fix View-As behaviour in one clean migration.

PROBLEM SUMMARY (for context, not to re-explain):
- The app is still using Replit OIDC auth, causing redirects to replit.com/oidc and failures at /api/callback.
- My owner account (tckeche@gmail.com) was created via Replit OIDC and does not have a password set.
- When viewing as Tutor, creating a course hangs because backend auth is not truly established.
- OTP for students/parents is not ready and should be disabled until Twilio is live.

REQUIREMENTS (IMPLEMENT EXACTLY):

PART A: REMOVE REPLIT OIDC AS AUTH PROVIDER
1. Completely remove Replit OIDC as an authentication dependency.
2. Stop using replitAuth.ts, setupAuth, or isAuthenticated from Replit.
3. Remove or disable:
   - Replit OIDC issuer usage (https://replit.com/oidc)
   - /api/callback handler for Replit OIDC
   - Any automatic redirects to Replit consent screens.
4. Protected routes must no longer depend on Replit Auth in any way.

PART B: USE APP-OWNED AUTH ONLY
1. Use the existing app-owned auth system (email + password + sessions).
2. Replace isAuthenticated middleware with a new middleware that:
   - checks the app’s own session user
   - does NOT redirect externally
3. Ensure cookies/sessions continue to work with fetch/React Query.

PART C: BOOTSTRAP OWNER SO I AM NEVER LOCKED OUT
1. Implement a one-time bootstrap endpoint, enabled ONLY if an env var exists:
   - ENV VAR: BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN
2. Endpoint example:
   POST /api/bootstrap/super-admin
3. This endpoint must:
   - Require BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN in a header
   - Create or update user with email tckeche@gmail.com
   - Set:
     isSuperAdmin = true
     isActive = true
     status = "active"
     role = "admin"
     adminLevel = 4
4. If this user does not have a password set:
   - Allow setting a password via this endpoint
5. This endpoint must:
   - Refuse requests without the token
   - Be safe to remove or disable after first use

PART D: TEMPORARILY DISABLE OTP FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS
1. Remove OTP requirement for now.
2. Allow students and parents to:
   - Sign up with email + password
   - Sign in with email + password
3. Keep OTP code paths intact but inactive (for future Twilio integration).

PART E: FIX VIEW-AS TUTOR COURSE CREATION
1. Ensure "View As" only affects frontend routing and UI.
2. Backend permissions must still resolve against the real logged-in Super Admin.
3. Verify that POST /api/courses succeeds when:
   - Logged in as Super Admin
   - Viewing the app as Tutor
4. The Create Course dialog must complete and persist the course.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change scheduling logic.
- Do NOT change finance, invoices, payroll, or hour wallets.
- Do NOT redesign UI.
- This is an auth + permission stabilisation task only.

After implementing:
- The app must never redirect to Replit consent screens.
- Staff login must work via email + password.
- Students must log in without OTP.
- I must always be able to log in as Super Admin.

Implement carefully and test before replying.
