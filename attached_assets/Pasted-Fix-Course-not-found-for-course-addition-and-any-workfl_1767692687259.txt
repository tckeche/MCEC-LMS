Fix “Course not found” for course addition and any workflows that reference courses.

Goal
All course picking and course actions must work in the published Production app with no “Course not found” errors.

Step 1. Identify the failing request
Use the browser Network tab and reproduce the error.
Record:
1. The endpoint path
2. The request payload
3. The response status and body

Step 2. Fix the root cause based on the payload
A. If the payload is sending backendUniqueId, code, name, or anything that is not the real course primary key
Then:
1. Update every course dropdown to use course.id as the selected value.
2. Display backendUniqueId or title as the label only.
3. Ensure the API payload fields are named consistently as courseId and contain course.id.
4. Add frontend validation that blocks submit if courseId is missing or not a valid id format used by the database.

B. If the backend is expecting course.id but some callers send backendUniqueId
Then make the backend tolerant:
1. In the relevant API handler, attempt lookup by id first.
2. If not found, attempt lookup by backendUniqueId.
3. If found by backendUniqueId, proceed using the resolved course.id.
4. Log a warning once per request that backendUniqueId was used so we can later remove the fallback.

Step 3. Production database consistency check
Confirm which database the published app is using.
On Production, run or call a debug safe endpoint to confirm:
1. The count of courses
2. The course ids being returned
3. The environment flag used by the server

If Production has no data but Preview does, add an Admin only tool:
1. Admin page action “Copy dev data to production” is NOT acceptable because it is dangerous.
2. Instead create a controlled “Export courses and enrollments from preview” and “Import into production” admin tool, restricted to Super Admin and protected by a one time confirmation phrase.
If that is too heavy, create courses manually in production and ensure flows work end to end.

Step 4. Add automated checks so this never regresses
Add a small E2E or integration test that:
1. Creates a course
2. Fetches course list and selects the created course by id
3. Performs the failing action that previously returned “Course not found”
4. Asserts 200 or 201 and confirms the database row exists

Acceptance criteria
1. The request payload always sends courseId equal to course.id.
2. “Course not found” never appears when selecting a course that is visible in the dropdown.
3. The fix is verified on the published Production URL, not only in Preview.
4. Provide me the exact endpoint that was failing and a short note showing the before payload and after payload.
Do not change scheduling logic or finance logic.
Only fix course identification, lookups, and production data consistency.
